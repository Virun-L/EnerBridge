                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        
                           <p>The webpage uses semantic HTML to organize content into clear sections like header, main, section, and footer, improving both readability and accessibility. A responsive navigation bar with icons and links allows easy movement between pages, while a full-screen background video adds visual appeal without interfering with content, thanks to CSS properties like z-index and pointer-events.</p> 
                           <p>Content is displayed in a responsive Flexbox grid of tiles, each containing images, titles, descriptions, and call-to-action buttons. CSS styles create a clean, modern design using a green-themed color palette, shadows, and hover effects for interactivity. The “Back to Top” button enhances navigation and is fixed in place for accessibility.</p>
                           <p>Responsive design is handled with media queries to adapt fonts, spacing, and layout for smaller screens. Accessibility is addressed with descriptive alt text on images, clear visual hierarchy, readable fonts, semantic tags, and icon-text pairings. Overall, the page is functional, mobile-friendly, visually appealing, and inclusive.</p> 
                         
                    
                    <h3 >Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>Accessibility has been addressed throughout the page to ensure it is inclusive and user-friendly for all. Semantic HTML elements like header, nav, main, and footer provide a logical structure that helps screen readers interpret and navigate the content effectively. All images include descriptive alt attributes, enabling visually impaired users to understand visual content through screen readers. The navigation and interactive elements use standard a tags and buttons, ensuring full keyboard accessibility. Icons are always accompanied by text labels, so their meaning is clear even if the icon doesn’t load or can’t be seen. Additionally, the design uses high-contrast colors and readable font sizes to improve visibility and comprehension for users with visual impairments. Overall, these choices contribute to a more accessible and inclusive web experience.</p>

                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The webpage is built using a combination of semantic HTML and modern CSS to ensure a clean layout, responsive design, and a visually appealing user experience. The structure begins with semantic HTML tags such as header, nav, main, section, and footer, which help organize the content meaningfully. This not only improves readability and maintainability but also enhances accessibility and SEO. The header contains a logo and navigation bar, while main holds the primary content, including the mission statement and content tiles. The footer is used to provide additional information and links, ensuring consistent structure across the site.</p> 
                        <p>In terms of styling, CSS Flexbox is used extensively to manage layout alignment, such as centering elements and creating responsive grids for the content tiles. The display: flex and flex-wrap properties allow the layout to adapt to various screen sizes. Properties like box-shadow, border-radius, and hover transitions are used to create depth and interactivity, giving elements a modern and polished look. For visual emphasis, colors like teal and green are used to reflect the clean energy theme, and consistent font sizes ensure readability.</p>
                        <p>The background video is implemented using the video tag and styled with CSS properties such as position: fixed, z-index, and opacity to create a full-screen background without obstructing the main content. Media queries are employed to make the page responsive, adjusting font sizes, paddings, and layout directions for smaller screens. Buttons and links are enhanced with hover effects using transform, box-shadow, and color transitions to provide interactive feedback. Altogether, the use of semantic HTML and efficient CSS ensures that the webpage is functional, aesthetically pleasing, and accessible across devices.</p>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>Accessibility has been carefully considered in the implementation of this webpage to ensure it is inclusive and usable for all users. Semantic HTML tags such as <b>header, nav, main, section</b>, and footer provide a meaningful content structure that helps screen readers navigate the page more effectively. All images include descriptive alt attributes, allowing visually impaired users to understand visual content. The navigation bar and interactive elements use standard HTML tags like <b>a</b> and button, which are fully accessible via keyboard. Icons are paired with clear text labels to ensure their purpose is understandable even without visual cues. 
                       Additionally, high-contrast color schemes, readable font sizes, and responsive layouts help users with visual or motor impairments interact with the site comfortably across different devices.</p>

                <h2 id="Table">Table</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>This webpage uses semantic HTML5 elements like <b>header, nav, main, section,</b>  and <b>footer</b> to structure content logically and enhance accessibility. The navigation menu is built with a list of links paired with FontAwesome icons to improve usability and visual clarity.</p> 
                        <p>Information is displayed in well-structured tables featuring grouped headers via <b>rowspan</b> and <b>colspan</b>, with images and icons that help users quickly identify regions and data categories. ARIA attributes on tables support screen readers, making the data accessible.</p>
                        <p>A background video plays silently and loops behind the content, styled using fixed positioning, full-screen size, and reduced opacity to add visual interest without distracting from the text.</p>
                        <p>The CSS styling applies a clean, professional theme using centered headings, subtle shadows, rounded corners, and green accent borders consistent with the energy theme. Tables have alternating row colors for readability, bold text and color highlights for important figures, and a white background for the logo cell to emphasize branding</p>
                        <p>The design is responsive, with CSS media queries converting tables into vertical, block-style layouts on smaller screens. The use of ::before pseudo-elements adds labels to each data cell, ensuring mobile users can still understand the data clearly.</p>
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p></i>Accessibility was prioritized by using semantic HTML5 elements like <b>header, nav, main, section, and footer</b>, which help screen readers understand the page structure and navigate content efficiently. Navigation menus are built with lists <b>(ul and li)</b>  and descriptive link text combined with icons, ensuring both visual clarity and screen reader friendliness.</p>
                        <p>Tables include ARIA labels (aria-label) that describe their purpose to assistive technologies, making the complex data easier to interpret for users with disabilities. The use of clear header cells with rowspan and colspan improves logical reading order.</p>
                        <p>Icons from FontAwesome include meaningful alt text or are paired with text to convey information without relying solely on visuals. The background video includes fallback text to inform users if their browser cannot play the video.</p>
                        <p>Colors and contrasts are chosen to be visually clear, supporting users with color vision deficiencies. The “Back to Top” button is keyboard accessible and has visible focus and hover states, ensuring it can be used by keyboard-only users.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the responsive design restructures tables on smaller screens to ensure content remains readable and navigable across devices, improving accessibility on mobile.</p>

                    <p>This webpage uses HTML5, CSS3, and Font Awesome to create a clean, modern, and responsive layout focused on innovations in clean energy. The design features a video background, a navigation bar with icons, and an internal section menu for smooth scrolling between topics like wind turbines, solar power, and hydrogen energy.</p>

                    <p>Each content block is styled using the .tile class with rounded corners, shadows, and hover effects, while images use glowing green borders and subtle scaling on hover. Custom bullet icons and emphasized paragraphs enhance readability and visual appeal.</p>

                    <p>The page uses a consistent eco-themed color scheme with teal tones, responsive media queries for mobile devices, and a fixed “Back to Top” button for navigation. The footer links all student contributions, reinforcing collaboration and support for SDG 7: Affordable & Clean Energy.</p>
                      
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>The webpage is designed with accessibility in mind, using semantic HTML elements like <b>header, nav, main, and footer</b> to provide clear structure for screen readers and assistive technologies.

                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>

                    <p>One of the main challenges was integrating the full-screen background video without it disrupting readability or page performance. This was addressed by setting appropriate z-index, opacity, and pointer-events properties in CSS to ensure the video remained behind content and did not interfere with user interactions. Another challenge involved creating a fully responsive tile layout using Flexbox that maintained alignment, spacing, and content visibility across various screen sizes. This was solved by using media queries and flexible percentage-based widths.</p> 

                    <p>Ensuring keyboard accessibility and icon clarity required careful pairing of icons with descriptive text and thorough tab navigation testing. We also faced minor issues with image scaling and overlapping elements on small devices, which were fixed by adjusting container padding and setting max-width and object-fit properties.</p>

                    <p>One of the main challenges during implementation was ensuring the tables remained both visually appealing and accessible across all screen sizes. Initially, the tables were difficult to read on mobile devices due to their horizontal layout. This was resolved by using CSS media queries to convert the tables into stacked block layouts, and applying the ::before pseudo-element to simulate headers on each data cell. Another challenge involved maintaining readability with a background video, which risked distracting users from the content. This was managed by adjusting the video’s opacity and z-index, and adding a semi-transparent section background with a blur effect. Additionally, ensuring icon accessibility required us to pair visual icons with meaningful text to avoid relying solely on graphics. Through these challenges, we learned the importance of mobile-first design, the value of progressive enhancement, and how thoughtful styling choices can balance design aesthetics with accessibility.</p>

                    <p>From these experiences, we learned the importance of mobile-first design, progressive enhancement, and testing across different browsers and devices. These lessons helped us create a more robust, inclusive, and user-friendly homepage.</p>

                <h2 id="compliance" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; color: #437057;">Compliance</h2>

                <p>The pages created aim to comply with JANET regulations by following key principles related to accessibility, privacy, and ethical publishing standards. Content is built using semantic HTML5 to ensure clarity, machine readability, and accessibility for users with disabilities, aligning with WCAG 2.1 guidelines, which JANET supports. We have used descriptive alt text for all images, ensured keyboard accessibility for all interactive elements, and maintained a clear visual hierarchy with readable fonts and good contrast.</p> 

                <p>We also avoided the use of any inappropriate, copyrighted, or non-attributed content, adhering to ethical content standards and responsible use of open-source assets (e.g., FontAwesome, free icon libraries). User data collection features (if implemented) would be designed with GDPR compliance in mind, though in this project no personal data is collected or stored.</p>

                <p>While we acknowledge that this is a student project and not deployed on a live institutional server, every effort has been made to simulate a realistic, secure, and compliant web development process in accordance with JANET’s expectations for content quality, accessibility, and responsible digital conduct.</p>
