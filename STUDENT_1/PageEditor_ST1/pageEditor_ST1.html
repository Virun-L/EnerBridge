                <h2 id="Splash">Splash Screen</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        
                        <p>
                            The Splash Screen acts as a visual introduction to the EnerBridge website while the main content loads. It features a full-screen black background with the EnerBridge logo centered on the screen, animated using a pulsing effect to create visual emphasis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Just beneath the logo, three animated loading dots appear sequentially using CSS keyframes to simulate a smooth and modern loading experience. The background is layered with a looping, muted video that represents clean and renewable energy themes. This video is styled to cover the entire screen using `object-fit: cover`, and positioned behind all other content using `z-index` and `position: fixed`.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To maintain legibility of the foreground elements, a semi-transparent dark overlay is applied over the video using RGBA values and a backdrop filter. The splash screen also includes two content cards: one highlighting the EnerBridge mission and another displaying the team members' names, each paired with emojis for a friendly touch.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The layout relies heavily on Flexbox to center and space content consistently across devices. CSS animations like fade-in, blur, and glow effects are used to bring motion and personality to the interface. After a 7-second delay, the splash screen redirects users automatically to the homepage using a meta refresh tag.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Altogether, the splash screen combines branding, smooth animation, and immersive visuals to create a polished and engaging entry experience for users visiting the EnerBridge website.
                        </p>
                    
                    <h3 >Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>
                            Accessibility has been carefully considered throughout the splash screen. The structure uses semantic HTML5 tags to provide clarity for assistive technologies. A fallback message is included for users whose browsers cannot play the video.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Visual elements such as the logo and dots are animated in a way that avoids overstimulation. High-contrast overlays help keep text readable against the moving background, and the typefaces are legible on all screen sizes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The logo contains appropriate alt text for screen readers. The entire screen is designed to work without user interaction, so keyboard-only and screen reader users are not hindered by the automatic redirection.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Flexbox ensures that layout remains consistent across screen sizes, and the animations maintain sufficient spacing and timing to avoid disorientation. These choices make the splash screen both inclusive and visually effective.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The page utilizes CSS Grid and Flexbox to create a flexible and aesthetically pleasing arrangement of cards that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. Animations and hover effects are applied to cards and buttons to provide tactile feedback and enhance the user experience. The color palette revolves around greens and neutrals, reinforcing the eco-friendly theme of the platform.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A filter dropdown allows users to sort or narrow projects by categories or criteria, improving navigation and usability. Beneath the project listings, a dedicated section for user ratings and reviews provides social proof and transparency, encouraging trust and participation. This section includes star ratings, emoji feedback, and a form for submitting new reviews, all styled with consistent design language and accessible controls.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Volunteer Page also features a well-structured feedback form at the bottom, enabling users to share detailed comments and rate their experiences. The form uses accessible input controls, custom emoji rating inputs, and clearly labeled buttons with hover and focus states. Proper use of semantic HTML elements and ARIA roles ensures compatibility with assistive technologies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Overall, the Volunteer Page integrates robust front-end techniques including responsive design, smooth animations, and user interaction handling to create an inviting and functional space for community engagement in sustainable initiatives.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>
                            Accessibility considerations are thoroughly embedded in the Volunteer Page design. All interactive elements, such as buttons, dropdowns, and form inputs, are keyboard-navigable and include visible focus indicators. Semantic HTML5 tags are used to structure content logically, improving screen reader compatibility and navigation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Color contrast ratios have been carefully selected to meet WCAG guidelines, ensuring readability for users with visual impairments. The emoji rating system is implemented with hidden radio inputs paired with accessible labels, providing a clear and intuitive experience for assistive device users.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Responsive layouts guarantee that content is usable across a range of devices and orientations, with no loss of functionality or information. Animations and transitions are subtle and do not cause motion sickness or distraction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Error handling and validation feedback in the feedback form are presented in text and visually, helping users understand any input issues. Alt text is provided for all images to describe visual content to screen readers.

                         <p>
                            Accessibility is prioritized through keyboard navigability, meaningful semantic structure, and adherence to WCAG color contrast guidelines. The fixed video background includes an overlay to maintain sufficient contrast between text and background.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Headings and lists are properly structured for screen reader clarity. Images include descriptive alt attributes. Focus outlines and visible indicators assist keyboard users in navigation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Smooth scrolling and animations are subtle and non-disruptive, minimizing motion sickness risks. The responsive layout ensures content is accessible across devices, maintaining functional integrity without loss of information.

                   <h3>Splash Screen</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Challenges:</strong> Implementing a smooth and visually appealing animated logo with loading dots was tricky, especially ensuring it performed well across different browsers. Managing the timing for automatic redirection while keeping the loading screen seamless also required careful timing and event handling. Accessibility considerations such as keyboard focus and screen reader announcements were additional challenges.
                        </p>

                            <strong>Lessons Learned:</strong> I gained valuable experience working with CSS animations and keyframes, as well as coordinating animation timing with JavaScript. I also learned the importance of balancing aesthetic effects with accessibility and performance.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Content Page</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Challenges:</strong> Creating a fixed video background with an overlay that ensures text readability on all screen sizes was a major challenge. Structuring the content semantically and making internal navigation smooth and user-friendly required careful HTML and CSS planning. Ensuring responsive layouts using Flexbox and Grid took some trial and error.
                        </p>

                <p>The pages created aim to comply with JANET regulations by following key principles related to accessibility, privacy, and ethical publishing standards. Content is built using semantic HTML5 to ensure clarity, machine readability, and accessibility for users with disabilities, aligning with WCAG 2.1 guidelines, which JANET supports. We have used descriptive alt text for all images, ensured keyboard accessibility for all interactive elements, and maintained a clear visual hierarchy with readable fonts and good contrast.</p> 

                <p>We also avoided the use of any inappropriate, copyrighted, or non-attributed content, adhering to ethical content standards and responsible use of open-source assets (e.g., FontAwesome, free icon libraries). User data collection features (if implemented) would be designed with GDPR compliance in mind, though in this project no personal data is collected or stored.</p>

                <p>While we acknowledge that this is a student project and not deployed on a live institutional server, every effort has been made to simulate a realistic, secure, and compliant web development process in accordance with JANET’s expectations for content quality, accessibility, and responsible digital conduct.</p>
