                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        
                           <p><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> The feedback page integrates semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques to deliver a visually engaging and user-friendly interface. It uses a responsive layout with a centered form wrapped in a .fb-container, enhanced by a blurred glassmorphic background using backdrop-filter, giving it a soft, modern look. The full-screen video background (#bg-video) adds dynamic visual appeal while remaining non-intrusive through reduced opacity and fixed positioning.</p>
                           <p><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> HTML5 form elements, including input, select, textarea, checkbox, and radio inputs, are used semantically with accessibility in mind—labels are explicitly linked to form elements, and required fields are clearly indicated. CSS transitions and hover effects on form inputs and buttons provide interactivity, while emoji-based rating icons with hover and selection animations add an intuitive and playful UX touch.</p>
                           <p><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> The character counter for the message textarea is implemented with JavaScript for real-time feedback. A floating "go to top" button ensures better page navigation. Overall, the implementation prioritizes usability, aesthetics, and accessibility, aligning with responsive design principles.</p> 
                           
                         
                    
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i>Accessibility has been thoughtfully addressed throughout the feedback page to ensure it is usable by all visitors, including those with disabilities. All form fields are clearly labeled using label elements associated with their corresponding inputs, which supports screen reader navigation. Required fields are marked with a visible red asterisk and use the required attribute for validation. The use of semantic HTML elements such as fieldset, legend, and textarea provides structural clarity, enhancing keyboard navigation and assistive technology compatibility. Additionally, color contrasts between text and background are sufficient to aid users with visual impairments, and focus styles on interactive elements help users identify their current location within the form. The emoji rating system includes title attributes for screen reader descriptions, while the “Go to Top” button is keyboard-accessible and visually distinct. Combined with responsive design practices, these features make the page accessible, readable, and navigable for a broad range of users.</p>

                <h2 id="Team">Team Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> The Team Page is designed using semantic HTML and modern responsive CSS techniques to provide an engaging and interactive user experience while maintaining clear structure and functionality. Each team member is displayed using a grid layout (.team-container) with flexible columns (auto-fit) that adapt across screen sizes, ensuring mobile responsiveness. A blurred glass effect (backdrop-filter) enhances the card design visually, complemented by soft shadows and hover animations that lift the cards for a dynamic feel.</p>
                        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Profile images are styled uniformly with object-fit: cover to maintain aspect ratio, and names feature an animated underline effect on hover to improve interactivity.Team contribution details are initially hidden and revealed smoothly when the user hovers over or focuses on a team member's name, enhancing keyboard navigation accessibility. A visually engaging animated heading (.team-section h2) uses a shimmering gradient text effect created via background clipping and CSS keyframes.</p> 
                        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Overall, the implementation combines structured HTML with aesthetic and functional CSS transitions to create a modern, accessible, and user-friendly team presentation page.</p> 
                        

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i>Accessibility has been carefully incorporated into the Team Page to ensure all users, including those using assistive technologies, can navigate and interact with the content effectively. Semantic HTML tags like main, header, and h2 provide structure and meaning to screen readers. Each .team-member card is made keyboard-navigatable using the tabindex attribute, enabling users who rely on keyboard navigation to access individual profiles. The alt attributes on images ensure that screen readers can describe each team member’s photo meaningfully. Interactive elements such as names that reveal additional content on hover are also revealed on keyboard focus, ensuring parity between mouse and keyboard users. Text contrasts, such as dark text on light backgrounds, meet accessibility standards for readability. The layout is responsive, providing a smooth experience across different screen sizes and devices. These measures collectively enhance the accessibility and inclusivity of the page, making it usable for a wide range of users regardless of ability.</p>

                        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> The page showcases a structured and visually engaging layout using semantic HTML5 elements such as header, nav, main, and footer to organize content meaningfully and enhance accessibility. A full-screen background video is implemented with the video tag and styled using position: fixed and object-fit: cover to create an immersive visual backdrop without interfering with content readability. The .content-container employs a glassmorphism effect using backdrop-filter and linear-gradient, adding depth and modern aesthetics.</p> 
                        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> The internal navigation menu, styled as .internal-nav, provides quick jump links to each startup using accessible anchor tags and responsive flexbox layout. A responsive grid layout, defined with grid-template-columns, ensures the .company-card components adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes. Each card uses a combination of hover effects, badge indicators, and clear heading structure to present content in a clean, informative manner.</p>
                        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Consistent use of color themes, gradients, icons (via Font Awesome), and subtle animations like fadeIn enhance user engagement. Additionally, the page incorporates a floating "Go to Top" button with a fixed position and high contrast for easy navigation. CSS media queries provide mobile responsiveness, ensuring the design remains accessible and user-friendly across all devices.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Accessibility has been carefully considered throughout the design of this page to ensure inclusivity for all users. Semantic HTML tags such as <b>nav, main, and footer</b> are used to clearly define the structure, enabling screen readers to interpret and navigate the content efficiently. The background video includes plays inline, muted, and autoplay attributes along with a fallback message to ensure compatibility and reduce distractions for assistive technologies.</p>
                        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> All interactive elements, such as internal navigation links and buttons, are keyboard-accessible and include clear :focus styles for visible interaction cues. The “Go to Top” button is given an aria-label for screen reader users. Image elements across the page include descriptive alt attributes that convey meaningful context, aiding users who rely on screen readers.</p>
                        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Additionally, the use of high-contrast text, large font sizes, and hover/focus states enhances visual accessibility. Responsive design ensures the layout remains functional and readable across a wide range of devices and screen sizes, promoting usability for users with low vision or motor impairments.</p>

                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> During the development of this webpage, several challenges were encountered that provided valuable learning experiences. One of the main challenges was implementing a responsive grid layout that displayed company cards consistently across various screen sizes. Achieving smooth responsiveness required multiple iterations of CSS media queries and layout adjustments using grid-template-columns.</p>
                    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Another difficulty was ensuring accessibility without compromising the visual design—particularly balancing aesthetic features like background videos and animated text with accessible contrast and keyboard navigation. Debugging inconsistent image rendering and alignment across devices also highlighted the importance of using flexible units and object-fit properties. Moreover, optimizing performance while using high-resolution images and background video taught us to compress assets and manage z-index layering effectively. </p>
                    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Through this process, we learned the importance of semantic HTML, structured styling, and inclusive design principles—leading to a more user-friendly and professionally built webpage. These challenges strengthened our problem-solving skills and deepened our understanding of real-world front-end development.</p>
